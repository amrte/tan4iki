# TANЬ4IKI (tanb4iki) — Tank 1990 browser replica

**Current version: 0.6** (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). The title screen shows the name **TANЬ4IKI** and the version as `tanb4iki_v0.6`.

A from-scratch browser remake of **Tank 1990**, the NES/Famicom variant of Battle City.
It's plain HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript with no dependencies and no build step. Sprites are
stored as 16×16 palette bitmaps in code, matching the NES originals. Sound comes from a small 2A03-style synth
(pulse waves and 1-bit LFSR noise), tuned against the original effects for pitch, timing and noise rate.

## Play

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Double-clicking the file works too, because no server is needed.
You can also serve the folder (`python3 -m http.server`) or publish it with GitHub Pages.

**Single-file download:** [`dist/tanb4iki_v0.6.html`](dist/tanb4iki_v0.6.html) is the whole game in one HTML file,
which you can save anywhere and open offline. To regenerate it after changing the code, run `node tools/build.js`;
the file is named after the version in `js/version.js`.

### Controls

| | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1-player game | Arrows **or** WASD, fire with Space / Z / X / J / K / F, **B** button: B / C / N / Left Shift | — |
| 2-player game | WASD, fire with Space / F / G / V, **B** button: B / C / H | Arrows, fire with Right Ctrl / Right Shift / Numpad 0 / L / `/`, **B** button: Numpad 1 / K / `;` |
| Start / pause | Enter / P / Esc opens the pause menu (CONTINUE / SAVE GAME / QUIT); P or Esc resumes | |
| Fullscreen | double-click the game, or Settings → SCREEN | |
| Mute | M | |

| 3-4 players | P1 WASD, fire Space/V, mines C/B · P2 arrows, fire right Shift/Ctrl/Option or `/` `.`, mines `'` `;` · P3 IJKL, fire U, mines O · P4 TFGH or numpad 8/4/5/6, fire R or numpad 0, mines Y | |

Pick 2, 3 or 4 players on the title screen with left/right on the player row. Players III and IV start in the bottom corners.

**Gamepads** (USB or Bluetooth) work in every mode: pad 1 controls player I, pad 2 player II, and so on
(in a 1-player game every pad controls player I). Press any button on a pad once so the browser reports it.
A notice appears when a pad connects or disconnects, and pads that support it rumble when you're hit.

**Change any key or button:** Settings → SCREEN → **SET UP KEYS AND PADS**. Choose a player, select a slot, press A,
then press the new key (or a gamepad button for the pad rows). Each action has two key slots; Delete clears a slot; Esc cancels.
A key can only do one thing, so assigning it takes it away from wherever it was. Custom keys for a player apply in every mode.

**On a Mac** (Settings → SCREEN → CONTROLS, picked automatically on Apple devices) player 2 fires with **right ⌥ Option**,
right ⇧ Shift, `/`, `.` or `,` and drops mines with `;`, `'` or `L`, because MacBooks have no right Ctrl or numpad.
Return pauses, ⌃⌘F or a double-click toggles fullscreen, and fn+delete clears the map in Construction.

The **B** button drops a mine while you carry mines; otherwise it fires, like on the NES.
The game supports up to two gamepads (standard mapping). On phones and tablets, a D-pad and
fire buttons appear on screen.

## Features

- **Title screen** with brick lettering, **1 PLAYER / 2 PLAYERS / CONSTRUCTION** menu and a saved hi-score.
- **35 stages**. Stage 1 recreates the classic Tank 1990 field. After stage 35 the game loops
  with tougher enemy line-ups. Before the first stage you can pick any stage on the grey "STAGE" curtain.
- **Terrain:** bricks break away in 4 px strips, steel needs a star-3 tank, water needs the ship,
  forest hides tanks, and tanks slide on ice.
- **Player upgrades (stars):** fast shells → two shells → steel-breaking shells. A star at max level also
  lets you cut down forest.
- **All Tank 1990 power-ups:**
  helmet (shield), clock (freeze enemies), shovel (steel fortress around the eagle, which flashes
  before it reverts), star, grenade (destroy every enemy on screen), tank (extra life),
  **gun** (instant max level plus tree cutting) and **ship** (cross water, and the boat absorbs one hit).
- **Enemies can grab power-ups**, as in Tank 1990. They get shields, freeze you, strip
  the eagle's walls, armor up, gain steel-breaking shells, take to the water, or set off a grenade on you.
- **4 enemy types:** basic, fast, power (fast shells) and armor (4 hits, changes color
  as it's damaged). The 4th, 11th and 18th enemies flash red and drop a power-up when hit.
- 20 enemies per stage, with at most 4 on screen (6 in 2-player). The enemy reserve is shown in the side panel.
- **2-player co-op:** friendly fire briefly freezes your partner, and the player with more kills
  in a stage earns a 1000-point bonus.
- Spawn sparkles, shields, explosions, score pop-ups, the rising "GAME OVER", the tallied score screen
  and the big brick "GAME OVER" screen.
- An extra life at 20,000 points.
- **Construction mode:** move the cursor and press **A** (fire) to place or cycle 14 tile patterns, or **B** to cycle backwards.
  Press **Delete** to clear the map and **Enter** to play your map. Custom maps are saved in the browser.
- Chiptune sound effects and engine hum, made with Web Audio.

## Online play

Play with friends over the internet, peer-to-peer: the game data goes directly between your computers, with no
game server. Everyone needs the **same version** of the game file (send them `tanb4iki_v0.6.html`).
It works in the downloaded file or a hosted copy (e.g. GitHub Pages) in Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Edge;
the claude.ai preview link blocks these connections.

1. **Host:** title screen → **ONLINE: HOST** (left/right on that row switches HOST / JOIN). In the lobby, add
   **+ Online friend** for each friend (and **+ Player on this keyboard** for anyone next to you), up to 4 players.
2. Press **Create invite code** for a friend, then **Copy** and send it to them (any chat app or email).
3. **Friend:** title screen → **ONLINE: JOIN**, paste the invite code, press **Create reply code**, then **Copy** and send the reply back.
4. **Host:** paste the reply under that friend and press **Connect**. After a few seconds it shows *connected ✓*.
5. Repeat for each friend, then press **Start game**, pick a stage and play.

The host's computer runs the game and the host's settings apply. Friends use their usual keys or gamepad and see the
host's game, with its sounds. Each friend chooses their own items in the shop; the host controls stages, pausing and saving.
If a friend drops out, their tank waits; the host can send a new invite from the pause menu → **ONLINE PLAYERS**.
A friend leaves with Esc → **Leave game**. Codes work once; if a page is reloaded, make new ones.

**If it says "couldn't connect":** some networks (offices, schools, some mobile hotspots) block direct connections
between computers. Try another network (e.g. a home Wi-Fi), or this would need a relay server.

## Boss rounds

Every 10th stage is a boss stage: the boss plus a smaller group of escort tanks (8 by default). Destroy the boss to clear
the stage; its escorts blow up with it. The side panel shows the boss's HP bar and how many escorts are left.
Every big attack flashes a warning first, each boss changes behaviour at half HP, and a power-up drops at 75%, 50% and 25% HP.
Beating a boss scores 5,000–10,000 points and gives 25% off in the next shop. After stage 50 the bosses repeat with +50% HP each loop.
In 2-player games boss HP is 50% higher.

| Stage | Boss | How it fights | How to beat it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **Iron Bear** | slow heavy tank with a ram; 3-shell volleys; flashes red, then charges in a straight line, crushing bricks and anything in the way | dodge the charge; it's dazed afterwards (longer if it hit steel) and takes double damage |
| 20 | **Mole** | moves underground (only a dust trail), surfaces near you or the eagle after a dust swirl, fires 8 shells in a cross, then burrows; breaks the steel ring in front of the eagle | hit it while it's up; at half HP it pops up twice and leaves mines |
| 30 | **Hydra** | sits on an island; left turret fires gatling bursts, right turret rockets, centre turret a laser beam down the screen | a ship is provided; destroy the turrets one by one, then the exposed core |
| 40 | **Phantom** | nearly invisible, shows itself only when firing; teleports and leaves decoys (more when angry, and then they fire) | decoys pop in one hit; only the real Phantom leaves tracks on the ice |
| 50 | **Dreadnought** | huge fortress tank; phase 1 cannons that break steel and a hatch that releases armor tanks; phase 2 mine lines and spread volleys; phase 3 crawls toward the eagle and fires laser beams at you | dig through its steel with star-3 or rocket shells; stay mobile in phase 3 |

Settings → BOSSES: boss rounds on/off, boss every 5–30 stages, boss HP 25%–300%.

## Save and load

Pause the game (Enter, P or Esc) and choose **SAVE GAME** to save exactly where you are: the stage, terrain,
tanks, scores, lives, upgrades and mines. The game also saves automatically at the start of every stage.
Choose **CONTINUE** on the title screen to resume; the game opens paused so you can get ready.
There is one save slot, kept in the browser.

## Field size and full screen

The classic field is 13×13 tiles. In Settings → SCREEN you can set **FIELD WIDTH** (13–60) and **FIELD HEIGHT** (13–40),
or choose **FIT** to match the window's shape. Bigger fields extend each stage by mirroring it outwards, with the
eagle kept at the bottom centre. **FIT TO MY SCREEN** sets everything at once for a laptop such as a 13" MacBook:
FIT width, FILL scaling and fullscreen. On a 16:10 MacBook screen in fullscreen that gives a 19×13 field.
**SCALING** is SHARP (whole-pixel scaling, crispest) or FILL (uses all the space).

## Shop

After each cleared stage, once the score tally finishes, the shop opens. Your score is your money: buying
something takes its price off your score. In 2-player games player I shops first, then player II. Use up/down to pick,
**A** (fire/Enter) to buy, and **Esc** when you're done.

| Item | Price | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Extra life | 5000 | one more tank |
| Star | 3000 | upgrade your tank one level (up to 3) |
| Gun | 8000 | max level and tree cutting |
| Ship | 3000 | cross water; the boat soaks one hit |
| Mines | 1500 | adds mines (3 by default) for the B button |
| Shovel | 2000 | steel walls around the eagle at the start of the next stage |
| Helmet, turbo, rapid, spread, rocket, pierce | 1000–3000 | that effect is active when your tank first appears in the next stage |

Upgrades you buy are kept until you lose a tank, as with ones picked up during play. In Settings → SHOP you can turn the shop off or
scale all prices (25%–300%). There is no shop after a game over.

## New power-ups

These 8 were not in the original game. They're marked with `*` in Settings and can be switched off there.

| Power-up | You get | If an enemy grabs it |
|---|---|---|
| **Turbo** (lightning) | 1.75× tank speed for 15 s | that tank speeds up |
| **Rapid** (three shells) | up to 4 shells on screen and quick fire for 15 s | that tank fires much more often |
| **Spread** (arrows) | every shot also fires left and right for 15 s | that tank fires 3-way |
| **Pierce** (arrow through wall) | shells pass through tanks, enemy shells and bricks for 15 s | its shells pierce too |
| **Rocket** | shells explode, breaking bricks and damaging nearby tanks, for 15 s | its shells explode (and can hurt the eagle) |
| **Mines** | 3 mines; drop one with **B**; it arms after a moment and blows up the next enemy that drives over it | that tank lays mines for you |
| **Ghost** | drive through bricks and water for 15 s | that tank drives through walls |
| **Coin** | 1000 bonus points | it steals 1000 points from each player |

## Settings

Choose **SETTINGS** on the title screen. Use up/down to pick a row and left/right (or A/B) to change it;
on desktop you can also click and use the mouse wheel. Changed values are shown in gold. Settings are saved
in the browser, and **RESET TO DEFAULTS** restores the classic game.
